The project completed the entire process from schematic to PCB layout to soldering and debugging, and to produce the finished productÍ¾ achieved the visualization of ECG information and remote communication functions by using the STM32 microcontroller and the 4G module.

Use NI Multisim 14.2 to run the simulation file, and use JLA EDA to open the schematic and PCB layout files of the project.
